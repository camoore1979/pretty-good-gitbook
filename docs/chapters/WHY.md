# WHY TO USE a GITBOOK

## Contents
<!-- toc -->

## Lots of other forms of documentation are just ok or plain suck

Wikis are great. Tough to keep synced with current state of code.

Sharepoint? Blah.

Code comments litter the code files.

READMEs are great, but should be short and introductory.

## Why document

Code cannot fully capture it's own intent.

Code cannot make you aware of environmental issues.

Code cannot explain how a team intends to behave and how code work should flow.

## What Gitbook provides

Structure. Like a book! Room for lots of documentation.

Built in search.

Built in glossary.

Graphics can be used.

Simple markup content.

Can be under common source control with your project's code. Nice!

It's extendable! Plugins are available!

It's local. 

And it's deployable. You could deploy to one of your dev/test environments
as a part of your CI/CD.

## Ideas for Great Project Documentation

How about...

A getting started guide?

A features or spec folder?

A git branching guide?

A code standard document?

A testing guide?

## Just be the guy

Who improves the project by documenting something.

[As Joel Spolsky says](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/25/getting-things-done-when-youre-only-a-grunt/), "create a pocket of excellence.".
